I had an absolutely wonderful day today! The weather was perfect, sunny and warm, and I spent the afternoon with my best friends at the park. We laughed so much and enjoyed a delicious picnic. But then, I got home and realized I had lost my favorite jacket somewhere. It really upset me because it was a gift from someone special. Still, Iâ€™m trying to focus on the good moments and not let it ruin my mood completely.
